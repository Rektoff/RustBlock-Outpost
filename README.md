# RustBlock Developer Snapshot 23'


Here [Rektoff](https://twitter.com/rektoff_xyz) core team in collaboration with [officercia](https://twitter.com/officer_cia) presented a knowledge base and market enviroment overview about Rust blockchain development. We saw a demand in the last months and got a lot of requests to create something related. So here it is! 

Any help would be rewarded soon. Let's build a foundation of new rustecean-based applications in blockchain field!
