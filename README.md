RustBlockSec V2 (17.09.2023)

Here @Rektoff core team in collaboration with @officercia presented a Systemization of Knowledge(SoK) about Rust educational guidelines for secured blockchain development. We saw a demand in the last months and got a lot of requests to create something related. So here it is! 

Any additional help would be rewarded soon. Let's build a foundation of new rustecean-based application in blockchain field!
