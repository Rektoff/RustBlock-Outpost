# RustBlock Developer Knowledge Base


Here [Rektoff](https://twitter.com/rektoff_xyz) core team presented a knowledge base and market enviroment overview about Rust blockchain development ecosystem. We saw a demand in the last months and got a lot of requests to create something related. So here it is! 

Any help would be rewarded soon. Let's build a foundation of new rustecean-based applications in blockchain field!
